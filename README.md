# Gomps Game Settings

There will always be games that don't work perfectly with the default GOMPS settings. This repo hosts good GOMPS settings for specific games.

File names have the format `[game-slug].json`. The game slug is generated from the game exe name, and you can find it in the BepInEx console where it says `Getting game settings from https://gomps-settings.pages.dev/[game-slug].json`. I'll make this clearer later 🙏
